# PG-Schema for Property Constraints

**PG-Schema-PC** is an extension of the PG-Schema formalism designed to specify structural constraints in property graph data models. Property graphs are commonly used to represent richly annotated and interconnected data; however, their flexible nature often lacks robust schema support. PG-Schema-PC addresses this by enabling the definition of:

- alternative groupings of properties,
- cardinality and multiplicity constraints,
- value-level conditions over property values.

This repository provides a formal grammar for PG-Schema-PC written in Extended Backusâ€“Naur Form (EBNF), alongside visual representations in the form of railroad diagrams to facilitate comprehension and practical adoption.
